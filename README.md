**Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program:**

**Introduction:**

Quantium has had a data partnership with a large supermarket brand for the last few years who provide transactional and customer data. You are an analyst within the Quantium analytics team and are responsible for delivering highly valued data analytics and insights to help the business make strategic decisions.
Supermarkets will regularly change their store layouts, product selections, prices and promotions. This is to satisfy their customer’s changing needs and preferences, keep up with the increasing competition in the market or to capitalise on new opportunities. The Quantium analytics team are engaged in these processes to evaluate and analyse the performance of change and recommend whether it has been successful.

In this program you will learn key analytics skills such as:

Data wrangling
Data visualization
Programming skills
Statistics
Critical thinking
Commercial thinking

**Task 1**

**Data preparation and customer analytics**
Conduct analysis on your client's transaction dataset and identify customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations.

**Here is the background information on your task**

You are part of Quantium’s retail analytics team and have been approached by your client, the Category Manager for Chips, who wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region.

The insights from your analysis will feed into the supermarket’s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year.

**Here is your task**

We need to present a strategic recommendation to Julia that is supported by data which she can then use for the upcoming category review however to do so we need to analyse the data to understand the current purchasing trends and behaviours. The client is particularly interested in customer segments and their chip purchasing behaviour. Consider what metrics would help describe the customers’ purchasing behaviour.

To get started, download the resource csv data files below and begin performing high level data checks such as:

Creating and interpreting high level summaries of the data
Finding outliers and removing these (if applicable)
Checking data formats and correcting (if applicable)
You will also want to derive extra features such as pack size and brand name from the data and define metrics of interest to enable you to draw insights on who spends on chips and what drives spends for each customer segment. Remember our end goal is to form a strategy based on the findings to provide a clear recommendation to Julia the Category Manager so make sure your insights can have a commercial application.

**LIFESTAGE:** Customer attribute that identifies whether a customer has a family or not and what point in life they are at e.g. are their children in pre-school/primary/secondary school.

**PREMIUM_CUSTOMER:** Customer segmentation used to differentiate shoppers by the price point of products they buy and the types of products they buy. It is used to identify whether customers may spend more for quality or brand or whether they will purchase the cheapest options.
